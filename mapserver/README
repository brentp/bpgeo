a python wsgi web script that copies the functionality of the mapserv
executable for WMS requests. 
currently only for WMS getMap requests.

under those constraints, it is a drop-in replacement for mapserv.
if python image library is installed adding buffer=true to the request url will cause the script 
to buffer teh image, eliminating edge effects of labels, or chopped
images.
