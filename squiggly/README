see Shapely. a python library to access geos functions to to
relational stuff with shapes (lines, points, polygons):

http://trac.gispython.org/projects/PCL/wiki/ShapeLy

this is just a silly afternoon project to make the functions available
in sqlite so you can do things like:

SELECT INTERSECTION('POLYGON((1.34 .....))', 'POLYGON((12.23 .....))
just as you would in postGIS.

however, the shapely directly provides these in a nicer syntax:

a.instersection(b)
a.union(b)
a.difference(b)

etc.
